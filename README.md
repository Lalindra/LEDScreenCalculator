# LEDScreenCalculator

## Work in progress.

This is made with the intentions of minising errors in Meters to Feet conversions in the events and staging industries. 

LED tile sizes are generally measured in millimeters(Metric) and stageboards and fabrication mostly used Feets and inched (Imperial). This causes errors to me made in drawings and installations. 

This tool helps to quickly understand the size of an LED in wall in both meters and feet.
